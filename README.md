# 320lab04


This lab is a program that takes an expression string and transforms it from infix form to postfix
form so that it can be printed out in the main file through two different functions, one for 
pre-order printing, and one for post-order printing. The last thing this program does is print out
the expression tree for the inputted string. This program works perfectly and took roughly 35 minutes to completely finish. I did not recieve any help for this lab, all work that was not given in the lab instructions was done by me.

To run this program, 5 files are needed:

The main (320lab04.cpp)
d_tnodel.h (unmodified)
inf2pstf.h (unmodified)
d_tnode.h (for d_tnodel) (unmodified)
d_expsym.h (for inf2postf) (unmodified)
d_except.h (for inf2postf) (unmodified

and compilation is done through:

g++ -c 320lab04.cpp
g++ 320lab04.o -o 320lab04
./320lab04
